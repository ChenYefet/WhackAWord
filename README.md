# Whack-A-Word
 An educational game that helps the user learn how to say certain food items in English. It works as follows:
 
 A vocabulary card with a flashcard image of a food item pops up from one of a series of holes in the ground. The user hears the name of the food item then must tap it, after which they hear it again and receive some positive feedback â€“ a tick with a sound effect. If they don't tap it, it retreats into its hole and pops up again in a random one. After each round of three successful taps, the number of cards that pop up simultaneously increases by one. Each card that pops up must have a different image to the other cards that pop up at the same time so that the user always chooses between different food items, and the user should always be tasked to tap a different food card to all previous food cards that they have correctly tapped during the game so that the game is more challenging and fun. At the end of the third round, the user wins.

## Description of code
### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`WhackAWordActivity`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`WhackAWordActivity`</span> class extends <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`AppCompatActivity`</span>, which is the superclass for activities that use the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`appcompat`</span> library. When <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`WhackAWordActivity`</span> is created, the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`onCreate`</span> method is called and sets the user interface to the one defined in <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`activity_whack_a_word.xml`</span>. It also fixes the screen orientation to landscape mode, initialises instance and class variables and calls the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`whackAWord`</span> method that plays the game recursively each time a card is correctly tapped.

The layout file <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`activity_whack_a_word`</span> contains only one card per hole, so to make it seem as though different cards can pop up from the same hole at different times, the image of each card that pops up is determined dynamically before it appears. Therefore, it is necessary to always keep track of which food items are assigned to which food cards.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> class
The abstract class <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> serves as a template for creating concrete subclasses of cards, such as the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class. It defines constant instance variables for the card's ID and the ID of its imageView, as objects of the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> class are modelled as having an imageView (where an image can be set).

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class is a subclass of <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> with a <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> instance variable, as objects of the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class are modelled as having a food item (or literally, the image of a food item).

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> class
The abstract class <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> serves as a template for creating concrete subclasses of vocabulary items, such as the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class. It defines constant instance variables for its name and audio ID, as well as an instance variable for its definition, which is not used in this game but may be useful for other applications that use the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> class.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class is a subclass of <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> with a constant instance variable for the ID of its image, as objects of the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class are modelled as having an image.

## Credits
This app is my attempt to implement the following mockups and instructions, given to me by the [onebillion](https://onebillion.org/) organisation after I sent them a job application. I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to create the SVG file that I needed in order to make each card appear to be coming out of their hole.

### Instructions
"Whack-a-word


Create a simple game for young children to learn vocabulary, that can be used on an Android tablet.

Overview
A series of holes in the ground are present. To start, a vocabulary card pops up from one of the holes, with a flashcard image. The child hears the word on the card then must tap it, after which they hear the word again then receive some positive feedback - a tick with sound effect. If they don't tap it, it retreats into its hole and pops up again in a random one. After three successful taps, the child starts to get more vocabulary moles simultaneously - two, then three. They must choose the correct one, or all retreat into their holes.
