# Whack-A-Word
 An educational game that helps the user learn how to say certain food items in English. It works as follows:
 
 A vocabulary card with a flashcard image of a food item pops up from one of a series of holes in the ground. The user hears the name of the food item then must tap it, after which they receive some positive feedback â€“ an animated tick with a sound effect, and the card changing colour multiple times in quick succession before it is hidden within the hole it had emerged from. If they don't tap it, it retreats into its hole and pops up again in a random one. After each round of three successful taps, the number of cards that pop up simultaneously increases by one. Each card that pops up must have a different image to the other cards that pop up at the same time so that the user always chooses between different food items, and the user should always be tasked to tap a different food card to all previous food cards that they have correctly tapped during the game so that the game is more challenging and fun. At the end of the third round, the user wins and hears, "Well done."

## Description of code
### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`WhackAWordActivity`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`WhackAWordActivity`</span> class extends <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`AppCompatActivity`</span>, which is the superclass for activities that use the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`appcompat`</span> library. When <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`WhackAWordActivity`</span> is created, the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`onCreate`</span> method is called and sets the user interface to the one defined in <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`activity_whack_a_word.xml`</span>. It also initialises variables, plays background music, animates the sky, and calls the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`playWhackAWord`</span> method that plays the game.

The layout file <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`activity_whack_a_word.xml`</span> contains only one card per hole, so to make it seem as though different cards can pop up from the same hole at different times, the image of each card that pops up is determined dynamically before it appears. The Selector class is used to keep track of which food item is assigned to which food card.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> class
The abstract class <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> serves as a template for creating concrete subclasses of cards, such as the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class. It contains constant instance variables for the card's ID and the ID of its imageView, as objects of the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> class are modelled as having an imageView (where an image can be set).

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class is a subclass of <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Card`</span> with a <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> instance variable, as objects of the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodCard`</span> class are modelled as having a food item (or literally, the image of a food item).

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> class
The abstract class <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> serves as a template for creating concrete subclasses of vocabulary items, such as the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class. It contains constant instance variables for its name and audio ID, as well as an instance variable for its definition, which is not used in this game but may be useful for other applications that use the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> class.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class is a subclass of <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`VocabularyItem`</span> with a constant instance variable for the ID of its image, as objects of the <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`FoodItem`</span> class are modelled as having an image.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Collections`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Collections`</span> class is responsible for managing collections, containing class variables for the available food items, the available food cards, the food items that have been correctly tapped, an audio queue which is used to store audio IDs and allow for the management of audio files in a 'first-in, first-out' (FIFO) manner so that they are played in a sequential order (rather than concurrently), and more.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`LevelProperties`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`LevelProperties`</span> class is responsible for managing the properties of levels, such as the current level, the number of cards to display, and the count of successful taps. It contains constant class variables for the last level of the game, the required number of successful taps per level, and the number of cards to display for each of the levels.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`ScreenProperties`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`ScreenProperties`</span> class is responsible for managing the properties of the screen. It contains a constant class variable for the width of a small screen in dp (density-independent pixels), and a class variable for whether the screen is small, which influences the app's layout.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Selector`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`Selector`</span> class is responsible for selecting which food items belong to which food cards during gameplay. It ensures that the chosen food items align with the game's rules as described above.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`AudioManager`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`AudioManager`</span> class is responsible for managing audio playback. It contains a constant class variable for the background music volume, as well as two other class variables: one that deals with the playback of audio in sequence, and another that deals with the playback of background music.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`TapManager`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`TapManager`</span> class is responsible for handling user interactions during gameplay. It allows the user to receive appropriate feedback upon tapping correct or incorrect food cards, and contains a class variable to keep track of when a correct food card was just tapped.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`DisplayManager`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`DisplayManager`</span> class is responsible for displaying food items on food cards.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`AnimationManager`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`AnimationManager`</span> class is responsible for managing animations. It contains constant class variables for managing time- and space-related animation properties, such as durations, delays, and translations, as well as other class variables for keeping track of animation properties that allow for an enhanced visual experience.

### The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`PositiveFeedbackAnimationManager`</span> class
The <span style ="font-family: Courier New">`PositiveFeedbackAnimationManager`</span> class is responsible for managing animations that provide positive feedback. It contains constant class variables for durations within positive feedback animations, as well as a constant class variable for the degrees in a rotation (360), created for the sake of clarity and used for the tick's rotation.

## Credits
This app is my attempt to implement the following mockups and instructions, given to me by the [onebillion](https://onebillion.org/) organisation after I sent them a job application. In addition to implementing it from scratch, I have made it usable on different types of Android device and implemented additional features not included in the instructions.
I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to create the SVG file that I needed in order to make each card appear to be coming out of their hole.
The 'well done' audio file was generated using [TTSMP3](https://ttsmp3.com/), the ['cards pop up'](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/backwards-whoosh-6317/), ['hide cards'](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/fast-simple-chop-5-6270/) and [background music](https://pixabay.com/music/beats-tvari-tokyo-cafe-159065/) audio files were downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) was used to convert them into m4a files and compress the background music audio, and [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) was used to trim the background music, the original track of which is [Tokyo Cafe by TVARI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y0iKIKOHf0).

### Instructions given to me
"Whack-a-word


Create a simple game for young children to learn vocabulary, that can be used on an Android tablet.

Overview
A series of holes in the ground are present. To start, a vocabulary card pops up from one of the holes, with a flashcard image. The child hears the word on the card then must tap it, after which they hear the word again then receive some positive feedback - a tick with sound effect. If they don't tap it, it retreats into its hole and pops up again in a random one. After three successful taps, the child starts to get more vocabulary moles simultaneously - two, then three. They must choose the correct one, or all retreat into their holes.

Notes\
\- Mockups are provided for you to work from .\
\- Use the provided image and sound assets.\
\- You can use whichever development environment and language you wish.\
\- Deliver an APK, source code and instructions to build.\
