/**
 * An object of the WhackAWordActivity class represents a game called Whack-A-Word
 * with the following description:
 *
 * A vocabulary card with a flashcard image of a food item
 * pops up from one of a series of holes in the ground.
 * The user hears the name of the food item then must tap it,
 * after which they receive some positive feedback â€“
 * an animated tick with a sound effect
 * and the card changing colour multiple times in quick succession
 * before it is hidden within the hole it had emerged from.
 * If they don't tap it,
 * it retreats into its hole and pops up again in a random one.
 * After each round of three successful taps,
 * the number of cards that pop up simultaneously
 * increases by one.
 * Each card that pops up must have a different image
 * to the other cards that pop up at the same time
 * so that the user always chooses between different food items,
 * and the user should always be tasked to tap a different food card
 * to all previous food cards that they have correctly tapped
 * during the game
 * so that the game is more challenging and fun.
 * At the end of the third round, the user wins
